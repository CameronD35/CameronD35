Hello world!

My name is Cameron DeMartini and I'm a Aerospace Engineering major (but probably Applied Physics at some point) who somehow found himself
programming in every programmer's favorite language: **JavaScript**. I know, kinda a poor attempt at humor, but I tried.

I love math, physics, graphic & web design, teaching, and life!

If you want to see some of my learning journey, my [blog](https://cameron-demartini.netlify.app/blog/) would suffice much better than this little description. It's a work in progress
and if you want to see the source code for my portfolio/personal website as a whole, check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/CameronD35/Portfolio).

Other than my shameless self-promo, I don't have too much else to share. Have a great day!
